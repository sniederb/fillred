# RecordEditor (FillRed)

This is an old C# project, see [want.ch](http://www.want.ch/FillRed/)


## To-Dos

User feedback

> zumindest wenn nur ein Layouttyp definiert oder enthalten ist, fÃ¤nde ich auch eine "normale" Grid-Ansicht Klasse 

> It would be very good if we could see all lines of a given record in the grid. Maybe you could use a combo-box where the user selects the chosen record structure and from there you could populate the grid with all items at once.


> With the navigation button a "goto item X" box would speed up navigation.

Idea: make current record index a text field, get onchange event (or onblur?) to set current on currencymanager (cmData)
